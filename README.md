News-Articles-Scraper-using-python

The world of Artificial Intelligence is changing everyday and hundreds of articles are being written and published. It consumes a lot of time in going through all the articles 
manually. In order to keep up with the latest news in the field of Artificial Intelligence, I created a Scraper that delivers me all the articles in a simple manner.

I used BeautifulSoup to scrape Article links from Google news.
Then with the help of newspaper library, I downloaded the articles and extraxted the text from them.
I also used Natural Language Processing technique - Text Summarization to summarize the articles.
I implemented Abstractive Summarization by making use of OpenAI API.
And Extractive Summarization by Latent Semantic Analysis Summarizer from Sumy library.

This gives me summaries of all the articles and I can browse through the summaries and then read the articles that interest me thus saving a lot of time.
